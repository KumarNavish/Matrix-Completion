# Matrix-Completion
__Experimental results__ 


* This work is related to the experimental section of [our][1] paper which involves comaparison to [Candes and Recht algorithm][2] for matrix completion problem.

* Here we compare the running time of existing convex relaxation based matrix completion methods (involving nuclear norm minimization)   with our *fixed-parameter-tractable* (__FPT__) algorithms.
* Assumptions
  *  Matrix entries are coming from _GF(p)_, where p is a prime number.
